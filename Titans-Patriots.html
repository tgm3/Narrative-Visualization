<p>Henry rushed for 182 yards and a touchdown while Tennessee's defense stymied Brady and perhaps ended 
<br>
his championship-filled New England career with a 20-13 wild-card victory Saturday night. 
<br>
<br>
The game's first three possessions wound up as three long scoring drives. A 29-yard screen pass to James 
<br>
White set up Nick Folk's 36-yard field goal, but Tennessee answered with a 75-yard march built around Henry. 
<br>
He had no role on the touchdown, Tannehill's pass to a Harvard man, tight end Anthony Firkser that made it 7-3.
<br>
<br>
New England counterpunched with its own 75-yard drive, taking temporary control of the game by victimizing Tennessee's 
<br>
defense on the outside. The Titans looked slow trying to protect the flanks as Sony Michel broke off a 25-yard run and 
<br>
White had a 14-yarder. Julian Edelman finished it with the first rushing touchdown of his 11 pro seasons, a 5-yard dash 
<br>
to the unprotected left side of the Tennessee D. New England appeared primed for another touchdown after Mohamed Sanu's 
<br>
14-yard punt return set up the Patriots at the Titans 47, and they steadily drove to first-and-goal at the 1. All they 
<br>
got was Folk's 21-yard field goal as three runs failed.
<br>
<br>
There had been no scoring in the second half when All-Pro Brett Kern's 58-yard punt that took up 10 of 
<br>
the final 25 seconds rolled down at the New England 1. Brady then was picked by former Patriot Logan Ryan 
<br>
for a 9-yard touchdown t o finish off the Patriots (12-5), who at one point were 8-0.</p>
